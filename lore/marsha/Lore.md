# Marsha
## Species: very musical rat
### She/Her

She's a very laid-back yet stubborn girl, she has a strange natural talent where she is able to play multiple instruments at once with her fingers and tail!

Currently, she is the owner of a disc containing a very important piece of software, but it's broken, so she must ask Someone to fix it for her! But, she must fight her oddly-musical middlemen before talking to her!
